The app typically uses data from weather\n          forecasting services and displays information such as temperature,\n          humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation chances. Weather\n          apps often provide detailed forecasts for the next few days, as well\n          as hourly breakdowns of upcoming weather conditions.\n        </Typography>\n        <Typography mb>\n          Some weather apps also provide additional features, such as weather\n          radar maps, severe weather alerts, and personalized notifications\n          based on weather conditions. These features allow users to stay\n          informed and make informed decisions about how to prepare for their\n          day, whether it's dressing appropriately for the weather or adjusting\n          their travel plans to avoid dangerous conditions.\n        </Typography>\n        <Typography mb>\n          Weather apps can be used by a wide range of people, including\n          commuters, travelers, outdoor enthusiasts, and anyone who wants to\n          stay informed about the weather. With the rise of smartphones and\n          mobile technology, weather apps have become increasingly popular,\n          allowing users to access real-time weather information from anywhere,\n          at any time.\n        </Typography>\n        <Typography variant=\"h4\" component=\"h2\" mb>\n          How to use:\n        </Typography>\n        <Typography mb>\n          It is very simple - just hit a menu button in left corner adn choose\n          Weather.\n        </Typography>\n        <Typography mb>\n          Enter a City name, it is required. State and Country are not required\n          but could adjust search results. Very useful if you want to know\n          weather in a small city with a famous name. Hit submit button and get\n          results of maximum 5 most accurate places.\n        </Typography>\n        <Typography mb>\n          Hit the <strong>Check Weather</strong> button near the city you are\n          interested in.

They are not working, so whole functionality related to this buttons\n          is about to be developed. But now it would take too much time to\n          modify both React App and to create a Node/Express app. But if you\n          read this, and feel very uncomfortable, I would be very happy about\n          cooperating on finishing this app.\n        </Typography>\n      </Container>\n    </>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Home;\n"],"names":["variant","component","mb"],"sourceRoot":""}
